503S Project


The two experiments that we are going to run are comparing Node.js and Apache+PHP comparison on the same AWS instance type and PHP performance with and without caching. 
This will allow us to evaluate the potential performance of a multiplayer version of our game using Node.js as opposed to apache, 
as well as determine how our game (which is using a Laravel php and easelJS back end) performs with and without caching.
